How to install
--------------

First of all, you'll need to install some dependencies. Here they are::

  python-dev
  python-setuptools
  libxml2
  libxslt1.1
  libxslt1-dev

After that, you'll need to install `pip`. The easiest way to do that is::

  easy_install pip
  
When it's done, run `make` to install all dependencies
